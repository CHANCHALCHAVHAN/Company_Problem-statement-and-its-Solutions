Problem Statement
In a kingdom ruled by numbers, a matrix of size NÃ—N represented the heart of the land. The matrix, filled with positive integers, had special rules:

Prime Numbers: These guardians of wisdom were replaced by 0 but left no trace in their rows or columns.

Perfect Squares: These symbols of balance had the power to mark their entire row and column with -1.

The kingdom's rulers needed to organize the matrix by applying these transformations and count:

The number of rows fully transformed to -1.
The number of prime numbers replaced with 0.
After processing the matrix, the rulers sought to present the transformed matrix and showcase the results of this magical process.

Note: -1 will have high priority than 0.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer N, the size of the matrix.

The next N lines contain N integers each, representing the elements of the matrix.

Output Format
Print two integers: the count of rows fully marked as -1 and the count of prime numbers replaced with 0.

Print the modified matrix with elements of the same row separated by a single space. Start the next row on a new line.

Constraints
2 <= N <= 100

2 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^6

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
4
2 6 4 8
5 9 12 15
10 11 18 7
20 21 25 16
Testcase Output
3 0
-1 -1 -1 -1
-1 -1 -1 -1
10 -1 -1 -1
-1 -1 -1 -1
Explanation
In the given matrix,
The element 2, 5, 11, 7 are prime so replace them with 0.
0 6 4 8
0 9 12 15
10 0 18 0
20 21 25 16

Now, 4, 9, 25 and 16 are perfect square, so replace the entire row and column with -1.
-1 -1 -1 -1
-1 -1 -1 -1
10 -1 -1 -1
-1 -1 -1 -1
Since -1 have high priority than 0, so it has replace all 0s.
Number of rows entirely marked as -1 = 3
Number of zeroes : 0 (we have to considered the final matrix after replacements)

Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
3
4 5 6
2 11 13
12 18 10
Testcase Output
1 2
-1 -1 -1
-1 0 0
-1 18 10
Explanation
In the given matrix,
The element 2, 5, 11 and 13 are prime so replace them with 0.
4 0 6
0 0 0
12 18 10

Now, 4 is a perfect square, so replace the entire row and column with -1.
-1 -1 -1
-1 0 0
-1 18 10

Since -1 have high priority than 0, so it has replace the 0s present in (0,1) and (1,0).
Number of rows entirely marked as -1 = 1
Number of zeroes : 2 (we have to considered the final matrix after replacements)
